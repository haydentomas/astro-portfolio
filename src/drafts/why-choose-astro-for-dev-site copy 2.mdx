## My favourite dev tools in 2024, what are they?

If we went back 10 years, the only tool I used was Dreamweaver and WSFTP. It was a simpler time. Now I have a whole host of tools that I use on a daily basis. Here are my favourites.

## Visual Studio Code

You will be hard pressed not to find a front-end website developer that doesn't include VS Code in their list of favourite tools. It's a great code editor that is free and open source. It has a great community and a whole host of plugins that you can use to make your life easier.

The interfCace is clean and easy to use. It has a built in terminal and a whole host of features that make it a great tool to use. I have been using it for a few years now and I can't see myself using anything else. Best of all, it's free!

I selected Astro because in my mind I felt now was the time to get my hands dirty and learn a new way of doing things. WordPress, as much as I enjoy using it is not easy to maintain. You need a plugin for every little thing, well you don't really, you could code teh plugins yourself, but what you want probably already exists.

Security is a big issue with WordPress. Plugins go out of date on a daily basis and stuff just breaks all the time. It can become expensive to maintain a WordPress site. I have clients that pay an annual fee to keep their sites up to date. I have clients that don't pay and their sites are a mess.
