    <h1>About Hayden Tomas</h1>
   
    <p>My name is Hayden Tomas, I am a front-end website developer based in Prestwood, Great Missenden.</p>
    <p>I have been developing websites and apps professionally since 2011. I started building websites for fun much sooner than that. Those of you old enough to remember software such as Microsoft Frontpage or the very first version of Serif Web Plus will understand the fun and games we had back then!</p>
    <p>I remember writing my very first program in basic, it was copied from the book that came with my beloved <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_Plus/4">Commodore Plus/4</a>. I was very new tro programming at 9 years old so certainly wasnt goiong to design my own software.</p>
    <p>So anyway, fast forward to 2011, I got my first website development job, and I am still with that agency to this day.</p>

     <div class="column"> <h2>What I do</h2>
       <p>My work keeps me busy developing websites in WordPress and DNN most of the time. I am very interested in learnign more about Jamstack, which is why I chose Astro to build this very website.</p>
       <p>There is nothing you can't build with Astro. Static sites now can compete with dynamic websites built in CMS systems such as WordPress, you can even create E-commerce solutions with static site generators.</p>
       <h2>My Skills</h2>
       <p>Now I do need to be honest about my skills. JavaScript is not my strong point, however I am learning!</p>
         
         <p>Part of the reason why I wanted to build my personal site in AstroJS is because it would force me to learn JavaScript.</p>

    <hr class=" pt-10"/>
    <p>I have spent most of my time creating skins, themes and building sites from scratch. I am the guy you come to when you need a site take from a PSD file or from Figma and turned into a working theme. I am not the guy you come to when you need a piece of functionality built from scratch with a language like JavaScript or Python. Not yet anyway!</p>
    <h2>So not any particular order, this is my toolset:</h2>

   </div>
 <div class="column"><ul>
   <li><strong>HTML</strong> (obviously!)</li>
   <li><strong>CSS and Sass</strong> (love that we now have native nesting!)</li>
   <li><strong>Tailwind</strong> (learning this has been fantastic, I have spent alot less time writing sass)</li>
   <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> (It's a work in progress!)</li>
   <li><strong>WordPress</strong> (Love it, Hate it - I prefer to build classic themes with ACF and PineGrow over pagebuilders)</li>
   <li><strong>DNN</strong> (DotNetNuke) - Spenty more than 10 years creating themes and skins. Recently discovered 2SXC which is frikking awesome. It's like advanced custom fields for DNN, sort of!</li>
