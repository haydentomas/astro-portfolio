## The Full Wax Project

We have been working with The Full Wax for many years. The website we had originally taken over was a flash website. It was difficult to manage with very little SEO due to the flash components.

At this time flash was still a thing but I already knew that it was on its way out. We developed the site in DNN, then later moved to WordPress. I would very much like to move the client over to a static Astro site because there are so few updates to the site and it doesnt need any special modules to make it work.

## SEO Optimisation

We have worked with the client to optimise their site for SEO. We have added meta tags, alt tags, and other SEO best practices to help the site rank better in search engines. This is done through the use of a simple SEO plugin and some research into the best keywords for the site. This enabled us to reach some of the top spots in Google for their chosen keywords.

## Security and Performance Optimisation

I have maintained the website since launch by enusing it is secure, up to date and running as fast as possible. I have also added a CDN to the site to help with the speed of the site. This has helped to improve the user experience and has helped to increase the number of leads generated through the site.

Security is managed through the use of the Patchstack security plugin. This plugin is a great tool for keeping the site secure and up to date. It scans the site for vulnerabilities and helps to keep the site secure. If vunerabilities are found I tend to them as required. To add to this I maintain regular backups and do regular checks to make sure that the site is always running optimally.

The security of this site is very important as it is a brochure site and the client relies on it to generate leads for their business. If the site were to go down it would have a big impact on their business. I notice at least 10 attempts to hack the site every day. I don't mention this to the client, it's just one the things I do as part of maintenance which I consider a worthwhile investment for any WordPress website.
