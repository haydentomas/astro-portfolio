# Project Full wax
In this post, we'll dive deeper into Astro.js and demonstrate how to build a simple blog using this powerful framework.

## Creating Blog Posts

Start by creating a new Astro component for your blog post. Here's an example of what the component might look like:

```
import { markdown } from '@astro/types';

const markdownFile = await markdown('./blog/my-first-post.md');

export function post() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{markdownFile.meta.title}</h1>
      <div>{markdownFile.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Routing

With Astro.js, routing is incredibly easy. You can define routes in your project's `astro.config.js` file:

```
export default {
  // ...
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/blog/*',
      component: './src/components/BlogPost.astro',
    },
    // Other routes...
  ],
};
```

Now, you can access your blog posts at URLs like `/blog/my-first-post`.
