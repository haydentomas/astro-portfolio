## I am a WordPress Developer, so why on earth did I choose Astro for my Dev site?

Seriously, I could have built this in WordPress, but where the fun be in that! I wanted to learn something new, and Astro seemed like a good choice. I have been following the project for a while. It's an intersting project and I wanted to see what I could do with it.

I have played about with a few static site generators in the past. I played with and loved Hugo. It was very easy to pick up, you didn't need to know any JavaScript and I managed to connect it up to a content management system called Forestry.io (Now called Tina). I tried to learn Gatsby and quickly got bored. I found it very difficult to get my head around.

I selected Astro because in my mind I felt now was the time to get my hands dirty and learn a new way of doing things. WordPress, as much as I enjoy using it is not easy to maintain. You need a plugin for every little thing, well you don't really, you could code teh plugins yourself, but what you want probably already exists.

Security is a big issue with WordPress. Plugins go out of date on a daily basis and stuff just breaks all the time. It can become expensive to maintain a WordPress site. I have clients that pay an annual fee to keep their sites up to date. I have clients that don't pay and their sites are a mess.

## Astro takes care of all security issues

Because Astro is a static site generator, it generates staic files with no database. Nothing to hack! No plugins to go out of date. No need to pay for updates. It's a win-win situation.

Build time will be slower than WordPress, but the site will be faster and more secure. I can live with that ðŸ˜ƒ.
